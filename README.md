# **ECE2112 - Programming Assignment 2**
### Experiment 2: Numerical Python (NumPy)

### Getting Started
In this repository, you will find my codes for Experiment 2 containing two problems:
1. Normalization Problem
2. Divisible By 3 Problem
<br>
The following tools were used in the completion of this experiment: <br>
- Anaconda Navigator 2.4.2 <br>
- Jupyter Notebook 6.5.4

### Normalization Problem
The instruction was to create a 5x5 ndarray stored in variable X. Then, normalize X and save the normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy.

### Divisible by 3
