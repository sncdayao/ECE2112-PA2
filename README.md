# **ECE2112 - Programming Assignment 2**
# **Experiment 2: Numerical Python (NumPy)**

## Getting Started
In this repository, you will find my codes for Experiment 2 containing two problems:
1. Normalization Problem
2. Divisible By 3 Problem
<br>
The following tools were used in the completion of this experiment: <br>
- Anaconda Navigator 2.6.0<br>
- Jupyter Notebook 7.0.8


## Normalization Problem
In this problem, a 5x5 ndarray was created and stored to variable X. The ndarray was normalized by performing operations on the obtained element-wise mean and element-wise standard deviation, which are existing features in the NumPy library. Then, the normalized ndarray was saved as *X_normalized.npy* and printed alongside the original Array X for comparison.


## Divisible by 3 Problem
In this problem, a 10 x 10 ndarray was generated containing the squares of the first 100 positive integers. These values were obtained using the *np.arange* operation and after squaring the integers, the ndarray was reshaped using the *reshape* operation. To obtain all the elements divisible by three, the modulo (%) operation was used on the entire ndarray. These values were saved as *div_by_3.npy* and printed alongside the original Array A for comparison.
